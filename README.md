## The mission
- Create a list of dishes that people will order online.
- The website should be responsive, it should work on a standard mobile resolution and on desktop
- You must list the food using some sort of card templates
- You should categorize your food to be able to filter it (ex: vegan, comfort food)
- You should create a shopping cart component to display the selected dishes and display the total amount of the delivery
- You should create a dark mode switch, to toggle your design between a light and a dark mode
